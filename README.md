### Rules of the Game
The game is played using:

The code maker (computer) chooses a pattern of four code pegs.

The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within eight to twelve turns. Each guess is inputted by placing a row of code pegs. Once placed, the code maker (computer) provides feedback by alerting whether or not the codebreaker got the order or the color or both correctly, but not which they got correct.

Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or twelve (or ten, or eight) incorrect guesses are made.
